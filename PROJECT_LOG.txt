SMART E-COMMERCE MICROSERVICES PLATFORM - PROJECT LOG
================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
- Building a microservices-based e-commerce platform
- 4 separate Spring Boot services
- Demonstrates microservices architecture and inter-service communication

ARCHITECTURE:
â”œâ”€â”€ product-service/    (MongoDB) - Product catalog & inventory
â”œâ”€â”€ user-service/       (PostgreSQL) - User management & basic auth
â”œâ”€â”€ order-service/      (PostgreSQL) - Order processing
â””â”€â”€ api-gateway/        (Spring Cloud Gateway) - Centralized routing

TECHNOLOGY STACK (CURRENT):
- Backend: Spring Boot 3.5.4, Java 17
- APIs: Spring Web (MVC), Spring WebFlux (Gateway + Order clients)
- Data: Spring Data JPA (User/Order), Spring Data MongoDB (Product)
- Security: Spring Security Basic (default user)
- Gateway: Spring Cloud Gateway (server-webflux)
- Build: Maven

PLANNED/NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:
- JWT/OAuth2, Swagger/OpenAPI, Redis
- Rate limit enforcement (gateway) beyond logging/counter
- Shopping cart and payment integration (order service)
- Docker/Kubernetes manifests and AWS deployment assets

DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS
================================================================

PHASE 1: PROJECT SETUP âœ… COMPLETED
-----------------------------------
- Multi-module structure in place with 4 Spring Boot services

PHASE 2: PRODUCT SERVICE âœ… COMPLETED
------------------------------------
- Model, repository, service, controller implemented
- CRUD + search/filter endpoints working
- MongoDB config present (localhost:27017)

PHASE 3: USER SERVICE âœ… COMPLETED
----------------------------------
- JPA entity, repository, service, controller implemented
- Basic authentication enabled (admin/admin123)
- CRUD + search/validation/auth endpoints working

PHASE 4: ORDER SERVICE â–¶ IN PROGRESS
------------------------------------
- Entities, repositories, services implemented
- Controller endpoints for CRUD, items, and status updates
- Inter-service validation via WebClient (user/product)
- Event publisher/listener present
- Outstanding: shopping cart, payment integration

PHASE 5: API GATEWAY â–¶ IN PROGRESS
-----------------------------------
- Routes configured for products/users/orders
- CORS configured
- Global filters present: AuthenticationFilter (logging), RateLimitFilter (counter only)
- Outstanding: JWT integration and rate-limit enforcement

PHASE 6: SERVICE INTEGRATION âœ… PARTIAL
--------------------------------------
- Inter-service calls working
- Distributed transaction flow implemented for order creation
- Global error handling present

PHASE 7: DEPLOYMENT & TESTING ðŸš§ PENDING
----------------------------------------
- No Docker/K8s/AWS artifacts yet
- Load/performance testing not set up yet

VERIFIED ENDPOINTS (via API Gateway)
------------------------------------
- Product: /api/products (CRUD, search)
- User: /api/users (CRUD, auth, search, validation)
- Order: /api/orders (CRUD, items, status)

CURRENT STATUS
--------------
- Active work: Phases 4â€“5 polishing; Phase 6 partially complete
- Next tasks:
  1) Enforce rate limiting in gateway
  2) Introduce JWT (gateway + services)
  3) Implement shopping cart & payment in order-service
  4) Add Swagger/OpenAPI
  5) Add Docker/K8s/AWS deployment assets

RESUME IMPACT (CURRENTLY ACCURATE):
- Implemented 3 microservices + API gateway with inter-service validation
- Built 20+ REST endpoints across services (CRUD/search/auth/status)
- Verified end-to-end order flow through API Gateway
